# hospital_managment_system
The Hospital Management System is developed using Java as the primary programming language, with data stored in a MySQL database. It features an Admin Panel, where administrators manage doctors, patients, appointments, and generate reports for hospital performance. Doctors access the Doctorâ€™s Panel, allowing them to view and update patient records, schedule appointments, and manage prescriptions. Patients have their own Patient Panel, where they can book appointments, view their medical history, and access prescriptions and test results. All the system's data, including patient details, doctor profiles, and hospital resources, is securely stored in MySQL. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used to connect Java with MySQL for executing SQL queries and managing the database. The system ensures smooth data retrieval, updates, and management, providing a streamlined approach to hospital operations. This structure supports efficient workflows for all users. By leveraging Java and MySQL, the system ensures scalability, security, and ease of data management.
